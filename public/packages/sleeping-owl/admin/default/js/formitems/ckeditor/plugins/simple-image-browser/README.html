<h1 id="ckeditor-simple-image-browser">CKEditor Simple Image Browser</h1>
<p>This repository is for the simple image browser. A free plugin made for those who look to make it easy on the user to insert an image to their content. A simple click on the image and WHAM!</p>
<h3 id="how-to-install">How to install</h3>
<p>You can build this together with CKEditor. You will need to configure this afterwards with the AJAX url. No other setup is required. You can set the config like so.</p>
<pre><code>// Add this line if you haven&#39;t build CKEditor with this plugin.
CKEDITOR.config.extraPlugins = &#39;simple-image-browser&#39;;

// Add this line anyways. You need it to get your images.
CKEDITOR.config.simpleImageBrowserURL = &lt;INSERT URL TO AJAX FILE HERE&gt;;
</code></pre><h3 id="json-response">JSON Response</h3>
<p>The JSON Response exists now only of the url to the file. Nothing more is needed and all your logic can go in the AJAX file. Here is a example of what the JSON response should look like.</p>
<pre><code>// JSON Response Example
[{
    // File 1
    url: &lt;URL TO FILE HERE&gt;
},{
    // File 2
    url: &lt;URL TO FILE HERE&gt;
}]
</code></pre><h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>I want to add the following features in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Different listing types, not just thumbnails</li>
<li>Hooks so you can further customize and control the user experience</li>
</ul>
